## Point Value Calculator for Warhammer Fantasy Battles (2nd edition)

It allows you to assign point values for your custom and/or random miniature figures, based on the point value system presented in the "Combat" booklet of the second edition box. You can

* Modify any of the twelve characteristics for your figure (Move, Weapon Skill, etc.)
* Select melee, missile weapons, armour, and mount for your figure 

The default values are given for a standard human figure, and it includes one close combat weapon; such as a sword, knife, or club. Other weapons and armour costs extra points. Most values (such as Bow Skill, Weapon skill) are capped at 10 --though the rules allow for extreme creatures who are above these limitations, in extreme cases.
