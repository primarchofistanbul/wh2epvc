## Point Value Calculator for Warhammer Fantasy Battles (2nd edition)

It allows you to assign point values for your custom and/or random miniature figures, based on the point value system presented in the "Combat" booklet of the second edition box. The default values are given for a standard human figure, and it includes one close combat weapon; such as a sword, knife, or club. Other weapons and armour costs extra points.
